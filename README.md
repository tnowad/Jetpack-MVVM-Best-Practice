We published an exclusive interview on Juejin about this project being "sold as a course" [ã€ŠWhatâ€™s it like to have your open-source project turned into a course and sold for over 10 million?ã€‹](https://juejin.im/post/5ecb4950518825431a669897)

This project is designed to help developers **understand Googleâ€™s open-source Jetpack MVVM components and their purpose and responsibility boundaries** through high-frequency application scenarios.

At the same time, this project serves as the "supporting project" for the [ã€ŠLearning Android Againã€‹](https://xiaozhuanlan.com/topic/6017825943) column's Jetpack MVVM series articles. **The content of the articles and the project code design reflect my unique understanding of Jetpack MVVM, and I hold copyright for this.**

# Preface

Last week, I published an article [ã€ŠIn-depth Jetpack MVVMã€‹](https://juejin.im/post/5dafc49b6fb9a04e17209922) on various "tech communities." Initially, I thought it would go unnoticed, especially in 2019 when Android was being criticized. But to my surprise, the article gained attention from architects and technical managers at "well-known domestic companies" and Android developers from "world-class companies."

Feedback from readers shows that most Android developers have recently stepped out of their comfort zones and started exploring and applying Jetpack MVVM in real-world projects.

Unfortunately, there is an abundance of **disjointed, repetitive, code-heavy articles** about Jetpack MVVM online. These articles neither provide a "complete perspective" to help readers clarify the context nor help new Jetpack learnersâ€”often creating confusion and discouraging them.

The good news is, in this issue, we bring you the **best practices for Jetpack MVVM**, carefully crafted!

# Project Introduction

I have 3 years of experience in "mobile business architecture" practice and design, leading or participating in the "reconstruction" of many medium to large-sized projects. I have a deep understanding of Jetpack MVVM's efforts in **establishing standardized development patterns to reduce unpredictable errors**.

In this case study, I will show you how Jetpack MVVM **simplifies** and transforms what would otherwise be a very error-prone and time-consuming development task into a simple process with just a few lines of code.

> ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘† Key Point!

In this project:

> We arrange two sets of **completely different layouts** for **landscape and portrait** modes, and with the help of knowledge like [lifecycle](https://xiaozhuanlan.com/topic/0213584967), [rebuilding mechanism](https://xiaozhuanlan.com/topic/7692814530), [state management](https://xiaozhuanlan.com/topic/7692814530), [DataBinding](https://xiaozhuanlan.com/topic/9816742350), [ViewModel](https://xiaozhuanlan.com/topic/6257931840), [LiveData](https://xiaozhuanlan.com/topic/0168753249), [Navigation](https://xiaozhuanlan.com/topic/5860149732), we easily achieve **seamless switching between portrait and landscape layouts without unexpected errors** with just a few lines of code.

> We have multiple Fragment pages that display **playback status indicators** (including play/pause button states, current index indicators for the playlist, etc.) and will show you "how" and "why" to use [LiveData](https://xiaozhuanlan.com/topic/0168753249) **together with** the reliable source [ViewModel](https://xiaozhuanlan.com/topic/6257931840) or singleton to achieve **unified event distribution across the entire app**.

> We arranged cross-page communication between Fragment and Activity to show you how to implement **lifecycle-safe and message-syncing** communication between pages using **Demeter's Law** (also known as the Law of Least Knowledge) and UnPeekLiveData with an app-level SharedViewModel.

> We provide content such as view controllers, [ViewModel](https://xiaozhuanlan.com/topic/6257931840), Dispatcher, and DataRepository in directories like `ui.page`, `domain.request`, `data.repository`, etc. This demonstrates how the **one-way dependency** architecture design helps avoid issues like "memory leaks" through layered data requests and responses.

> The project code is written in ISO-certified industrial-grade Java. We also provide rich comments in the classes above to help you understand why the "skeleton code" is designed this way and how this design **avoids unexpected errors** in the context of software engineering.

Besides **mastering the best practices of MVVM in "simplifying complexity" code**, you will also gain the following from this project:

1. Clean code style and standard resource naming conventions.
2. In-depth understanding and proper use of the "view controller" concept.
3. Full use of AndroidX and Material Design 2.
4. Best practices for ConstraintLayout.
5. **Excellent user experience and interaction design**.
6. No use of Dagger, no complex tricks, and no writing overly difficult code.
7. The one more thing is:

You can now download and experience it from the "App Store"!

# Who is Using

According to anonymous surveys of friends' "open-source library usage," by May 28, 2022, we learned that major companies, including "Tencent Music, NetEase, BMW, TCL," have referenced or are using this architecture model we open-sourced, or are using frameworks like [UnPeek-LiveData](https://github.com/KunMinX/UnPeek-LiveData) that we maintain.

We have updated the statistics in the relevant open-source library ReadMe, and those who missed the survey don't need to worry. We will continue to keep it open and periodically update the companies and products listed in the form, inviting more people to participate in using and providing feedback on the "architecture components" to foster continuous evolution and upgrades.
